- **Prompt Structure**: How to organize prompts for maximum effectiveness
- **Context Management**: Providing the right amount of background information
- **Output Control**: Directing AI responses in specific formats and styles
- **Troubleshooting**: Debugging ineffective prompts

### Breakthrough Moments
*Share specific examples of student "aha!" moments or particularly successful prompt improvements.*

## Student Feedback and Results

### Immediate Impact
- Pre/post class skill assessments showed significant improvement
- Students reported increased confidence in AI interactions
- [Include specific metrics or quotes if available]

### Follow-up Success Stories
*If available, share how students applied these skills in their work or projects.*

## Lessons Learned as an Instructor

### What Worked Well
- **Hands-on Practice**: Students learned best by doing, not just listening
- **Real Examples**: Using actual prompts and results resonated strongly
- **Collaborative Learning**: Peer feedback improved everyone's skills

### Areas for Improvement
- **Time Management**: Some advanced topics needed more time
- **Technical Setup**: [Any technical challenges with AI tools]
- **Diverse Skill Levels**: Balancing content for different experience levels

### Teaching Insights
- Prompt engineering is both art and science
- Students need practice with failure as much as success
- The field evolves rapidly - curriculum must stay current

## Resources and Further Learning

### Recommended Tools
- **ChatGPT**: OpenAI's flagship model
- **Claude**: Anthropic's conversational AI
- **Prompt Libraries**: Collections of effective prompts
- **Testing Platforms**: Tools for prompt experimentation

### Additional Resources
