For my MIT Master's Thesis I developed a novel method to localize a robotic end effector using the Koopman Operator and image observables. Through my reseach, I designed and built a dexterous gantry crane system where a 6-DOF robotic arm can be inversly mounted to a gantry crane to assist with heavy industry machinery tasks in construction factories.
