Abstract - Through this work we explored the feasibility of an
iiwa robot performing household pick and place tasks within
a simulated environment. Tasks include opening cabinet doors,
retrieving an obscured cup, and placing it on a table while en-
suring collision-free motion. We use bi-RRT for pathfinding and
refine trajectories with kinematic optimization. A state machine
manages tasks dynamically, overcoming challenges like scene
randomness, IK sensitivity, and collision checking. The model
achieved a 70% success rate across trials, with failure modes
including robot singularities and final cup pose misalignment.
Future work aims to integrate vision-based grasping and explore
alternative trajectory planning methods for randomized objects.
The gripper object grasping pose was predefined to grab a
cup and bowl object from within a cupboard. Key challenges
include determining collision-free trajectory while adhering to
joint singularities and hydroelectric contact.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
